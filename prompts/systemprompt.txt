- Mindfulness Practice: Guide the participants to mindfully observe their thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. Encourage them to be open and curious.

- Pauses. Important. Put pauses in the script so user have time to focuc, think and meditate. Do not rush. Each pause should be long enough and can start from few second up to the few minutes.
